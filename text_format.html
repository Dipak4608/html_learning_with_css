    <p class=" t_indent t_height w_spacing">Ratan Tata was born in Bombay (now Mumbai), during the British Raj, into a Parsi Zoroastrian family, on 28 December 1937.[11] He was the son of Naval Tata (who was born in Surat and later adopted into the Tata family), and Soonoo Tata (the niece of Tata group founder Jamsetji Tata). Tata's biological grandfather, Hormusji Tata was a member of the Tata family by blood. In 1948, when Tata was 10, his parents separated, and he was subsequently raised and adopted by Navajbai Tata, his grandmother and widow of Ratanji Tata.[12] He had a younger brother Jimmy Tata[13] and a half-brother, Noel Tata, from Naval Tata's second marriage to his stepmother Simone Tata and two half-sisters Shireen and Deanna Jeejebhoy from Soonoo Tata's second marriage.</p>
